    2020-05-13 MSS Code Factory CFAll 2.13.11189 Manufactured by 2.12.11188 Most of the 2.13 projects are now under GPLv3 except cartridges and models
    
    The 2.13 CFLib and CFCore projects are under the GNU Lesser General Public License, Version 3
    or later, with an option for commercial licensing by contacting Mark Stephen Sobkow
    via msobkow@sasktel.net.
    
    The knowledge base of rule cartridges are under the LGPLv3 with commercial
    option, as users should be able to write their own cartridges extending the tool's
    provided they don't modify the tool's cartridges to do so.  I interpret a rule cartridge
    in a knowledge base as being a "library" of rules, and the knowledge base that I ship with
    the tool is the "system library" on which I expect most users to build.
    
    The models in the 2.13 release are now individually licensed under the same terms as the
    projects that they model.  As a result, copies of Apache_V2.txt, gpl-3.0.txt, and lgpl-3.0.txt
    are shipped with MssCF 2.13.
    
    The foundation projects upon which most applications are built include CFSec, CFInt, and CFCrm
    2.13.  These three projects are under an Apache Version 2 license to allow anyone who uses the
    tool to use a SchemaRef to incorporate those projects as a foundation upon which to build.
    
    The remaining 2.13 projects are under GNU General Public License, Version 3 or later, with
    an option to purchase commercial rights.  See the project welcome page for licensing fees and
    options.
    
    This is a github-only release that will trickle out for the remainder of today as I verify
    that each project is "license clean" before pushing the properly licensed code to github.  I
    want no traces of old license terms hiding away if I can help it.
